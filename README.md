How to Start building in Quantum 

 1.Foundational Concepts:
Start with corporate training courses:

* IBM Quantum Training
  [https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en]

* NVIDIA – Code-focused Quantum Training (GitHub)
  [https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/tree/main]

* IQM Quantum Computer Training
  [https://www.iqmacademy.com/]

When to use GPT / Gemini / other AI tools

* Initial brainstorming
  (Ask it to validate ideas only based on pre-existing research / startups / experiments)

* Literature review
focus on research papers in this order
1. Foundation papers (basics)
2. Review papers (references)
3. Recent conferences (SOTA)

* Asking for relevant algorithms
4 kinds of quantum algorithms you could work on:
1. Pure quantum
2. Hybrid quantum-classical / variational
3. Quantum-inspired algorithms
4. Post-quantum algorithms 


* Initial documentation
Creating initial docs such as:
  * README files 
  * Design documents
  * requirements.txt, etc.

* Creation of questions to ask yourself
  (To clear conceptual and implementation doubts)

* Project planning
Help create project deadlines 
1. Plotting a timeframe
 2.  Understanding the best workflow

* After manual coding
Further validating your projects using:
  * Error handling
  * Testing
  * Benchmarking techniques

When NOT to use GPT / Gemini / other AI tools

* Mathematical formulation of quantum problems
  (Ising representation, Hamiltonian equations, etc.)

* Quantum computing services’ API calls

* Most recent developments / tools in SDKs
  (Qiskit / Cirq / D-Wave Ocean; they evolve too fast)

* Debugging
  (Without up-to-date documentation and references)

* In-depth understanding of algorithms
  (Why, when, and where to use a specific quantum algorithm)
